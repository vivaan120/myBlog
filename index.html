        <p>Travelling helps me connect with new people, which helps to improve my interpersonal skills.
            Based on the geography we meet people from various races, regions. It helps to understand their background and connect with them. This acquired skill helps when we work with a distributed global team.
            Travelling makes me independent and build my confidence.
            It's like food for the soul which is necessary to de-stress and then get back to my day job with new renewed vigour.
            For a year full of work, projects, ratings, traffic, tensions travel is like a fresh dose of much needed oxygen!
            And that's why it's my hobby.</p>
